# React Learning App


## Description

This React Learning App is a project I created while learning React. It covers several fundamental concepts of React, such as Components, Import/Export, Styling components, Props & Prop-types, Conditional Rendering with if-Else Statement and ternary operator, Introduction to React Hooks, and practical use cases of useState and useEffect Hooks. Additionally, it also demonstrates the implementation of React-Router-Dom v6 for handling page navigation and using hooks with React-Router-Dom v6.


## Features

1. **Movie Displaying Page:** This page fetches movie data and displays it in the form of cards, allowing users to view detailed information about each movie.

2. **Record Keeping Page:** Users can input a name and email, which will be stored and displayed. Additionally, users can remove the records they don't need.

3. **Data Fetching Page:** This page fetches data from a dummy API and presents it in a tabular form, giving users a practical understanding of data fetching in React.
