# React Learning App

![React Learning App](path/to/your/image.png)

## Description

This React Learning App is a project I created while learning React. It covers several fundamental concepts of React, such as Components, Import/Export, Styling components, Props & Prop-types, Conditional Rendering with if-Else Statement and ternary operator, Introduction to React Hooks, and practical use cases of useState and useEffect Hooks. Additionally, it also demonstrates the implementation of React-Router-Dom v6 for handling page navigation and using hooks with React-Router-Dom v6.


## Features

1. **Movie Displaying Page:** This page fetches movie data and displays it in the form of cards, allowing users to view detailed information about each movie.

2. **Record Keeping Page:** Users can input a name and email, which will be stored and displayed. Additionally, users can remove the records they don't need.

3. **Data Fetching Page:** This page fetches data from a dummy API and presents it in a tabular form, giving users a practical understanding of data fetching in React.

## Getting Started

To run the React Learning App locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run the following commands:
npm install
npm start

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React-Router-Dom v6

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to all the online resources, tutorials, and documentation that helped me in my journey to learn React. Special thanks to the React community for providing valuable resources and support.

I am excited to share this project on GitHub, showcasing my progress and understanding of React. It serves as a reflection of my learning journey and practical application of various React concepts. I look forward to improving this app and expanding my skills further. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
